Task 2:
For this task, weâ€™d like you to create a cloud-based AI workflow using your preferred tools (e.g., LangChain, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP). The workflow should include the following:

Data Processing: Use a dataset of your choice (e.g., public datasets like Kaggle) to preprocess and clean the data.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model (e.g., regression, classification) using the preprocessed data.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a REST API using a cloud platform or framework like Flask/FastAPI.
Testing: Include a test script to verify that the deployed model works as expected.
Include comments explaining your approach to each step of the workflow.
This task will allow you to demonstrate your end-to-end AI solution development skills, including data processing, model training, deployment, and cloud integration.

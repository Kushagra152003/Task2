An ai workflow has been created to the best of my capabilities, it includes a preprocessor,
a machine learning model builder and a docker host, I still have a long way to go in building agentic systems
but this file consists of detailed progress of building an agentic workflow
I wanted to build a system of agents which could interact with each other easily, but the sharing of files 
between these systems proved to be tough.
